# Cart_Wiz
CartHub is a React-based web application designed to simplify and enhance the online shopping experience by providing a centralized platform for managing shopping carts.

## Functionality Overview:
Cart Wiz provides a comprehensive set of features to enhance the shopping experience:

* Sorting Options: Easily find products by sorting them based on price (low to high, high to low) or ratings. Sorting helps identify the best deals and popular products swiftly.

* Filtering Capabilities: Customize product searches by filtering items based on availability. You can include or exclude out-of-stock items to focus on available products. Additionally, the platform offers a "fast delivery only" option, ensuring prompt item delivery if time is critical.

* Search Functionality: A powerful search feature allows searching for products by entering keywords or specific product names. This helps locate items efficiently and accurately, saving time and effort.

With these features, Cart Wiz aims to simplify the shopping experience, providing users with a seamless journey from browsing to checkout.

**Note**: There is a known issue in retrieval of image url's. So working on it to replace with any online API.
