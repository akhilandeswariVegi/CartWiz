## Functionality Overview:
Cart Hub provides a comprehensive set of features to enhance the shopping experience:

* Sorting Options: Easily find products by sorting them based on price (low to high, high to low) or ratings. Sorting helps identify the best deals and popular products swiftly.

* Filtering Capabilities: Customize product searches by filtering items based on availability. You can include or exclude out-of-stock items to focus on available products. Additionally, the platform offers a "fast delivery only" option, ensuring prompt item delivery if time is critical.

With these features, Cart Hub aims to simplify the shopping experience, providing users with a seamless journey from browsing to checkout.

**Note**: There is a known issue in retrieval of image url's. So working on it to replace with any online API.
